# post-quantum-crystography
Post-Quantum cryptography(Combines Newhope algorithm and Steganography)

This is a modification to Newhope post quantum algorithm. The keys of the algorithm is compressed using a lossless compression algorithm. 
Further, steganography is combined to the algorithm to provide additional security. 

Requirements:

1.Python3

2.stegano(python library for steganography)

To execute run the following:
python3 test.py
